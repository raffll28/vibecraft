Manage Claude Code in style!

**[Try it instantly at vibecraft.sh](https://vibecraft.sh)** — still connects to your local Claude Code instances!

**New:**
- **Animations** — What's Claude up to? Watch him! ◕ ‿ ◕

Vibecraft uses your own local Claude Code instances — no files or prompts are shared.

![Three.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Three.js-black?logo=threedotjs) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-blue?logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vibecraft)

## Requirements

- **macOS or Linux** (Windows not supported - hooks require bash)
- **Node.js** 18+
- **jq** - for hook scripts (`brew install jq` / `apt install jq`)
- **tmux** - for session management (`brew install tmux` / `apt install tmux`)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
brew install jq tmux       # macOS
# sudo apt install jq tmux  # Ubuntu/Debian

# 2. Configure hooks (one time)
npx vibecraft setup

# 3. Start server
npx vibecraft
```

Open http://localhost:4003 and use Claude Code normally. You'll see Claude move around the workshop as it uses tools.

**From source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nearcyan/vibecraft
cd vibecraft && npm install && npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:4002
```

**To uninstall:** `npx vibecraft uninstall` (removes hooks, keeps your data)

## Browser Control (Optional)

Run Claude in tmux to send prompts from browser:

```bash
tmux new -s claude
claude
```

Then use the input field in the visualization with "Send to tmux" checked.

![Multi-clauding](public/multiclaude.png)

Run multiple Claude instances and direct work to each:

1. Click **"+ New"** (or `Alt+N`) to spawn a new session
2. Configure name, directory, and flags (`-r`, `--chrome`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`)
3. Click a session or press `1-6` (or `Alt+1-6` in inputs) to select it
4. Send prompts to whichever Claude you want

Each session runs in its own tmux, with status tracking (idle/working/offline).

See [docs/ORCHESTRATION.md](docs/ORCHESTRATION.md) for the full API and architecture.
